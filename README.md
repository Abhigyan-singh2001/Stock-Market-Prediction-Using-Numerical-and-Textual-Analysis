# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis
Predicting stock market prices using past information and doing sentiment analysis based on news headlines.
This project talks about how we can use the ARIMA model to forecast stock prices in Python and how to use VADER to predict the Sentiments of news headlines.
Forecasting is done by using ARIMA(auto regressive integrated moving average) algorithm which is very useful while forecasting something based on past values.
Sentiment analysis is done by VADER of NLTK library.
News Headlines data can be downloaded from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DPQMQH here.
